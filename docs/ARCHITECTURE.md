# Architecture

> Status: **partly implemented**: hardware profiles, display port with fault
> handling (`components/display`), boot test screen (`components/ui`), pure
> SafeArea geometry (`components/geometry`) with native tests, and
> `include/app_config.h` (boot-layout, display-failure and debug defaults).
> Everything else is planned.
> Decisions in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md). Planned contracts below do not
> describe implemented services or a completed resource acceptance.

## Goals
- Show football data for one club on small displays (first: 240×240 round).
- Scale to other boards, displays (360/466 px, rectangular), touch and
  additional data providers **without rewriting** screens or logic.
- Robust 24/7 operation: no hangs, bounded memory, safe updates.

## Responsibilities and rules
| Module | Does | Does not |
|---|---|---|
| Provider | HTTP request, parse, map to canonical model, report capabilities | Decide when to poll, know about screens |
| Repository | Hold current snapshot, detect changes (e.g. `lastScoreChangeAt`) | Network I/O |
| Scheduler | Choose polling interval per state, enforce request budget | Parsing |
| Screen-mode resolver | Pure function: (time, data state, settings, inputs available) → screen set + default | LVGL, I/O |
| Presenter | Build a view model for one screen from snapshot + settings | Draw |
| View | Create LVGL objects from layout tokens, render view model, emit `UiAction` | Business logic, data access |
| Input mapper | Map raw events (button press/long, touch gesture) to `UiAction` by device config | Navigation decisions |
| Navigation controller | Apply `UiAction` to screen stack / scroll state | Input hardware |
| Overlay manager | Show/hide overlays by priority and timeout, place them inside the round area | Know overlay content logic |

## Threading and data ownership (planned)
- **UI task**: owns LVGL exclusively. Other tasks never call LVGL; they post
  events. Views update only in this task.
- **Network/data task(s)**: HTTP requests and parsing.
- **HTTP server task**: from `esp_http_server`; hands work to other tasks via
  events/queues for anything slow.
- Communication via event bus (`esp_event`) and bounded queues. Each queue
  needs a capacity, post/allocation-failure handling and a coalescing or
  rejection policy. Commands requiring acknowledgement must receive an
  explicit result when overloaded; they must not disappear silently.
- The repository has a single writer. Immutable snapshots need an explicit
  reader lifetime before their storage can be reused: two buffers alone do
  not protect a slow UI or Web reader. Readers take short protected copies of
  the data they need (ADR-017); the display task is the reader of live data,
  Web handlers only read small status/debug data. Copy sizes and lock times
  are measured when the repository is implemented.
- Model references and strings must outlive every reader and must never
  borrow storage from a discarded parser document. Each request carries a
  settings generation so an old club/provider request cannot publish into
  the new selection after a configuration change.
- **Current state (interim):** LVGL runs in the `esp_lvgl_port` task
  (priority 4, stack 7168 B, port defaults). The boot test screen is created
  once from `app_main` while holding `display::lock()` (recursive mutex of
  `esp_lvgl_port`). Exclusive UI-task ownership and its event protocol remain
  to be designed; current external LVGL calls hold the mutex.

## Display fault handling (implemented, device fault tests pending)
- `esp_lvgl_port` stays unchanged (ADR-015). All handling lives in
  `components/display` (own GC9A01 driver and `display_port.cpp`); limits in
  `include/app_config.h`.
- Failed draw: the driver sends a `NOP`. The SPI panel IO collects every
  queued transfer before a parameter command, so afterwards the LVGL buffer
  is free. The port then reports the flush complete to LVGL, and the screen
  is redrawn by the supervision timer (≤ 500 ms). After 3 consecutive failed
  draws the device restarts. If the drain fails too, the buffer state is
  unknown, so the device restarts immediately.
- LVGL supervision: an LVGL timer (500 ms) feeds a task-watchdog user. A
  stuck flush, a blocked transfer, a long-held LVGL lock or an LVGL assert
  stops it, and the task watchdog (5 s, panic enabled in `sdkconfig.defaults`)
  restarts the device. Never hold the LVGL lock for long work.
- Allocation: the port's heap allocations (context, two DMA draw buffers) are
  probed with identical size, alignment and caps before
  `lvgl_port_add_disp`; a shortage restarts the device. An LVGL pool shortage
  ends in the LVGL malloc assert (`CONFIG_LV_USE_ASSERT_MALLOC`) and then in
  the watchdog restart.
- Init failures (SPI bus, panel IO, panel, clear, LVGL, supervision) restart
  the device after switching the backlight off. The reset releases every
  resource, so there is no reverse-order cleanup. A clear buffer whose
  transfer state is unknown is not freed.
- Controlled restarts use `esp_system_abort` with the reason in the panic
  output. A reset record in RTC no-init memory counts consecutive abnormal
  resets (panic and watchdogs). After 3 of them the display is not
  initialised and the device runs headless until a power cycle or a normal
  restart. After 60 s of stable display operation the count resets.
- Profile resolution, SPI mode and clock are checked at compile time
  (`include/hw_target.h`).
- Fault injection: `cfg::kDisplayFault` compiles one test fault in (it must be
  `kNone` in normal builds). A multi-chunk partial transfer is not injectable
  without changing ESP-IDF. It cannot occur with the current sizing (one
  flush = one SPI transaction), and it uses the same drain path.

## Memory strategy (C6 has no PSRAM)
- Fixed-capacity model containers, allocated once.
- Bounded, measured library allocations and LVGL-pool allocations are allowed.
  Avoidable general-heap allocation churn remains prohibited. Event payloads,
  filtered parser documents and screen transitions still need peak and
  allocation-failure budgets.
- One screen alive at a time; LVGL objects of the previous screen are deleted.
- LVGL draw buffers partial, double buffered, internal DMA-capable RAM:
  1/12 of the screen height each (240×240: 2 × 20 rows = 2 × 9600 B), size
  computed from the profile (`components/display/display_port.cpp`).
  LVGL heap `LV_MEM_SIZE` = 32 KB static (`.bss`), see `sdkconfig.defaults`.
  This is the current boot-screen configuration, not a proven production
  minimum or sufficient end-state budget.
- JSON parsed directly from the HTTP stream with a field filter (ADR-009);
  the full response is never buffered.
- TLS: one connection at a time.

### Staged resource acceptance
The active C6 target is accepted in stages: baseline integration (WiFi/TLS,
filtered JSON, JPEG and HTTP server), complete data model and production views,
images/Web/debug operations, then supported maximum load and long-run operation.
Passing the first stage does not certify the complete application.

Heavy operations (TLS fetch with parsing, JPEG decoding, upload handling) run
one at a time by default; overlaps are allowed only where measured and bounded
(ADR-017). Before each stage, define capacities, overflow behaviour and
explicit reserves. Account for linked code/data SRAM,
LVGL pool (without counting it twice), DMA buffers, all task stacks, snapshot
storage and reader copies/leases, strings/events, queues, parser and TLS peaks,
view models, JPEG/layers, embedded Web assets, the NVS settings record, and filesystem
metadata/upload staging. Measure total free memory, largest free blocks, low-water marks,
stack usage and LVGL peaks/fragmentation with the permitted overlapping work.
Compare image occupancy and resource growth with the previous measured stage.
The complete C6 budget remains unproven until these workloads exist.

JPEG integration must include its filesystem adapter and the RGB888 input
conversion required by TJPGD when drawing to RGB565. Decoder output format does
not require a permanent full-screen RGB888 framebuffer. Measure actual decode
time, working memory, LVGL peak and flash growth using baseline JPEG assets.

First measurement (XIAO ESP32-C6, 2026-10-09, temporary diagnostic build that
was removed afterwards and remains in the Git history): the
baseline stage fits the current partitions with reserves (WiFi, TLS with the
full IDF certificate bundle, filtered JSON, LittleFS, JPEG scene and a small
HTTP server: 78 % of an OTA slot, largest free heap block ≥ 180 KB, minimum-ever
free heap ≥ 170 KB with TLS running while the scene redraws). Three findings
shape the image design:
- The C6 ROM linker script defines `jd_prepare` and `jd_decomp` (an older
  TJpgDec with a different layout) and they override LVGL's TJPGD. LVGL's
  functions must be renamed at build level (compile definitions for the LVGL
  component), otherwise the first JPEG draw crashes.
- LVGL's TJPGD decoder re-decodes the image from the top for every draw task
  (one per draw-buffer stripe): about 105 ms per 240×240 pass on the C6, so a
  full-screen redraw over 12 stripes takes 1.1–1.25 s. Text-only refreshes of a
  JPEG background cost 0.2–0.3 s. Fewer, larger stripes, a pre-rendered layer or
  uncompressed RGB565 images trade this against RAM or flash.
- LittleFS cannot replace a file that is open, and a draw task keeps the JPEG
  open while it decodes. An image upload must swap the file under the LVGL lock
  (temporary file, then rename), otherwise a replacement during a redraw fails.
This is integration evidence only, not the supported-maximum envelope.

## Scalability rules
- No absolute pixel values in views: positions/sizes from layout tokens
  derived from resolution, shape and size class.
- Round content must pass geometric safe-area tests; rendered visibility
  needs pixel-mask tests. Backgrounds, clipping containers, decoration and
  diagnostics have distinct contracts, detailed in [UI.md](UI.md). The
  diagnostic boot rings remain part of the accepted bring-up screen.
- Input-agnostic navigation: screens react only to `UiAction`s.
- New provider = new module implementing the provider interface + fixtures +
  capability flags; no change in presenters or views.
- New display/board = profile files + one env; a new controller also needs a
  driver. A new resolution requires its own DMA/draw-buffer, font, scene and
  flash/filesystem budget; hardware independence does not imply equal costs.
